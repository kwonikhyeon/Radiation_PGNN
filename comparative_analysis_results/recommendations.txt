=== DETAILED ANALYSIS AND RECOMMENDATIONS ===

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
The New-version Model (exp8) demonstrates superior performance across multiple key metrics:
- Better SSIM score (0.628 vs 0.532) indicating improved structural similarity
- More controlled intensity predictions (ratio ~1.0 vs ~4.2)
- Significantly lower intensity variation (std: 0.029 vs 2.62)
- Better quality distribution (2% good quality vs 0%)

DETAILED FINDINGS:

1. INTENSITY CONTROL:
   ✓ WINNER: New-version Model
   - Old-version: Mean ratio 4.23 (324% over-prediction), std 2.62
   - New-version: Mean ratio 0.996 (nearly perfect), std 0.029
   - Recommendation: The simplified model's intensity control is dramatically superior

2. SPATIAL ACCURACY (SSIM):
   ✓ WINNER: New-version Model  
   - Old-version: 0.532 SSIM
   - New-version: 0.628 SSIM (+18% improvement)
   - The simplified model better preserves structural information

3. FIELD CONSISTENCY:
   ✓ WINNER: Old-version
   - Old-version: Lower field variation (RMSE: 0.017)
   - New-version: Higher field variation (RMSE: 0.022)
   - Old-version shows more consistent spatial predictions

4. SIGNAL FIDELITY (PSNR):
   ✓ WINNER: Old-version (marginally)
   - Old-version: 19.22 dB
   - New-version: 17.98 dB
   - Small difference, but Old-version has slightly better signal reconstruction

5. OVERALL QUALITY:
   ✓ WINNER: New-version Model
   - New-version: 2% good, 97% moderate, 1% poor
   - Old-version: 0% good, 100% moderate, 0% poor
   - Better quality distribution in simplified model

STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS:

SHORT-TERM IMPROVEMENTS:
1. ADOPT SIMPLIFIED ARCHITECTURE: The simplified model shows clear advantages in intensity control and structural similarity. Consider it as the primary architecture.

2. ENHANCE FIELD CONSISTENCY: While simplified model excels in intensity control, improve spatial consistency:
   - Investigate regularization techniques for smoother field predictions
   - Consider spatial smoothness constraints in loss functions
   - Experiment with multi-scale feature fusion

3. INTENSITY CALIBRATION: While simplified model excels, ensure intensity calibration across different radiation levels:
   - Validate performance across full intensity spectrum
   - Test with real-world measurement noise levels

MID-TERM RESEARCH DIRECTIONS:
4. HYBRID APPROACH: Combine benefits of both models:
   - Use simplified model's intensity control mechanisms
   - Integrate Old-version model's signal fidelity strengths
   - Develop ensemble methods leveraging both architectures

5. PHYSICS-GUIDED IMPROVEMENTS:
   - Re-examine physics loss formulations for spatial accuracy
   - Implement progressive physics loss with emphasis on spatial consistency
   - Consider physics-informed attention mechanisms

LONG-TERM DEVELOPMENT:
6. UNCERTAINTY-AWARE MODELING:
   - Develop uncertainty estimates for predictions
   - Use uncertainty to guide measurement strategies
   - Implement confidence-aware loss functions

7. REAL-WORLD VALIDATION:
   - Test both models with real radiation measurements
   - Validate on different radiation source types
   - Assess performance in varying environmental conditions

CONCLUSION:
The New-version Model (exp8) is the clear winner for practical deployment due to:
- Superior intensity control (critical for radiation safety)
- Better structural similarity (important for field reconstruction)
- More stable and predictable performance
- Reduced computational complexity

However, achieving optimal balance between intensity control and spatial consistency remains a key challenge and should be the primary focus of future improvements.
